# tm-code-assessment

Coding assessment work for TM.

All relevant code (and feedback for the code review portion) is in `src/tm_code_assessment/core.clj`.

All tests (I modified one of them to handle a `:pre` condition) are in `test/tm_code_assessment/core_test.clj`.

To run the tests, you need to have Leiningen installed. Then run `lein test` in the root directory.
